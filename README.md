# Serverless Usergroup Program

![](./assets/User_group_web_header.png)

Community-driven Serverless usergroups, are hosted locally in cities across the world. Spread the knowledge and experience in building and running applications with serverless architectures at scale, on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, Kubeless, Webtask, and more. Get together to learn about serverless architectures, event-driven application development, microservices, FaaS and severless computing in general.

* **Do you want to start a Serverless Usergroup in your city?** 
* **Do you already have a usergroup and want us to help you grow it?** 

Join us to be part of the family of many [Serverless Usergroups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/serverless/) across the world. 

## Inquiries

We are here to help the local organizers get started with the usergroup! In order for us to help you, we request you please fill up the [inquiry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSCMFQc47wn1S0Y2H7LBjuvmoZW57cgBSwKC6vdnbd_7yvWA/viewform), and we will contact you at the earliest.

## Get Involved

* **Attend**: We host Serverless Usergroups in [many cities](https://www.meetup.com/pro/serverless/) around the world. Attend the next meetup one near you.
* **Organize**: Don't have a Serverless Usergroup in your city, but you’re a serverless enthusiast? Do you have strong local connections and organizational skills? We work closely with local partners to help launch new Serverless Usergroups.
* **Speak**: We’re always looking for speakers that want to share their experiences and present about serverless, at the meetup groups. Give a presentation, workshop or lightning talk at one of our usergroups.
* **Sponsor**: These usergroups wouldn’t be possible without the support of our generous sponsors and community partners. Let us know if you’re interested in hosting a Usergroup in your office space, or sponsoring food, drinks or other resources.

## Be an Official Serverless Meetup

With little or no effort, transform your usergroup to be an "official" Serverless Meetup. As long as you:

* Register your meetup on Meetup.com
* [Transfer](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002883031-How-do-I-transfer-my-Meetup-group-to-a-different-organizer-) your meetup.com group to the "Serverless User Group" organizer account. We will add the original organizers back in immediately. We need to be an organizer, ONLY so that we can pay for it. We will not interfere in the day to day activities of running the meetup.
* Add any local co-organizer(s) to build your meetup group [leadership team](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002474672-Building-a-leadership-team)
* Use the [Serverless User Group logo](./assets/Meetup_header@1x.png) as your "Meetup Group Logo" for your meetup
* Have a meetup at least once a quarter with a future goal of once a month
* Keep the theme of the event focused around serverless technologies. 
* The meetups including speakers and the talks that are presented, should adhere to the meetup [guidelines](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002897712-Meetup-Group-Policies-Standards-for-Meetup-Groups-)

### Transfer FAQ

1. When a new meetup account is created on meetup.com, do the organizer(s) setup payment with their credit card when they start?

When an organizer creates a new Meetup group, they set up payment with a credit card. That credit card will auto-renew until the organizer decides to cancel the organizer subscription. 

2. When a meetup nominates Serverless to become the Meetup organizer, how is the payment for the meetup handled? Does the  original payment get refunded? In future is Serverless billed for the meetup? How much time before the payment gets refunded?

When an organizer nominates Serverless to become the Meetup organizer, **meetup.com will not automatically refund them**. A subscription is tied to the person's account rather than to the group, so if someone has transferred the group to Serverless, the subscription will not automatically cancel. **If an organizer has transferred their group to you and they paid their subscription in the last 30 days, they are welcome to write to support@meetup.com for a refund**. Refunds will then take 3-7 business days to appear on credit card payments.

## Need help with your first meetup event?

Our advice to start up a new meetup is to start small. Some of the following tips can help:

1. Pick a date and a venue for your meetup and announce/promote your event at least 4 weeks in advance for maximum attendance. After you publish the event on meetup.com, please send us the link and we will tweet about it as well.
1. Start with a simple introductory meetup where you present something like "Introduction to Serverless". This cuts down the time in finding a speaker. If you need help with content, please let us know.
1. At your first meetup, you would expect 35-50 people to show up and that is your opportunity to socialize with the attendees and find out potential speakers and sponsors for future events.
1. Start off with minimal cost for food/drinks and then look for local companies that will sponsor the event. Give the sponsors 5 mins. of podium time to talk about their company.
1. Look for local sponsors that can sponsor simple raffle items like AWS Gift certificates and such. Raffle is a great way to attract people to the event.
1. Attend local events and talk to the speakers in those events. You already know how good they are!
1. Try to maintain a good cadence (like every month) for your events, so that attendees get used to the schedule.
1. Try to do video recordings of the talks if you can. You can tweet links to them later and get more visibility. At the minimum, please share the slides for the talks on your event page.
1. And foremost, focus on building the community, share knowledge and help people out.
